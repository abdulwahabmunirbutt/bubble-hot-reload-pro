# Bubble Hot Reload Pro ⚡

**A better way to preview your Bubble apps.**

I built this extension because I was tired of manually clicking "Refresh" on the black bar every time I made a change in the editor.

Most other tools are either simple timers (which reload while you are typing) or Bubble Plugins that you have to install inside every single project individually.

**This extension is different.** It lives in your browser, works on every project automatically, and reloads instantly when your app updates.

## 🏆 Why is this better than a Plugin?

There are Bubble plugins that handle auto-reloading, but they have a major downside: **you have to install and configure them for every new app you build.**

With **Bubble Hot Reload Pro**:

1.  **Install Once, Work Everywhere:** You install it in Chrome once, and it automatically works on all your current and future Bubble projects.
2.  **Real-Time Updates:** It detects the exact moment your editor saves a change and reloads the page immediately.
3.  **Sound Notifications:** It plays a subtle sound when the reload is finished. This is huge—you can look away or check your phone, and the sound tells you when your app is ready to test. No other tool does this.
4.  **Full Control:** You get a clean UI with settings to customize the theme, sound, and visuals.

## 🚀 How it works

It’s pretty simple:

1.  You make a change in your Bubble Editor.
2.  The extension detects the update immediately.
3.  It reloads your preview tab automatically and plays a sound so you know it's done.

## ✨ Features

- **Instant Reload:** Triggers the moment a change happens in your app.
- **Smart Audio Cues:** A helpful sound plays when the reload completes (great for multi-tasking).
- **Visual Feedback:** A "Reloading" badge and toast notification appear so you know it's working.
- **Dark & Light Mode:** A beautiful settings UI that matches your browser theme.
- **Zero Setup:** No need to add workflows or elements to your Bubble page.
